    <h3 class="text">History our Aqeanarium</h2>
    <div class="text">
        Once upon a time, in a small coastal town, lived a young and ambitious marine biologist named David. His childhood love for the sea and its inhabitants led him to aspire to create a place where every person could learn about the great wealth and beauty of the underwater world.

        Despite financial difficulties and a lack of experience in creating such facilities, David did not despair. Over time, he gathered around him a group of like-minded individuals - scientists, businessmen, and enthusiasts who shared his passion for the sea.
        
        Together, they embarked on a project to create a unique oceanarium that would not only be a place for entertainment but also a center for education and research. David and his team spent years working on the design, attracting investments, and collecting a collection of marine inhabitants.
        
        And finally, after several years of labor and effort, the oceanarium opened its doors to visitors. It was a place where everyone could see the beauty of the underwater world, learn about its amazing inhabitants, and participate in ocean conservation programs.
        
        Since then, the oceanarium has become an integral part of the city's life, attracting tourists from all over the world and inspiring a new generation of young sea and ocean explorers.
